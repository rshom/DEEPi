# Overview

Python code to manage raspberry-pis with cameras optimized for use underwater.

 2. Ability to create more complex scripts.
 3. Stereo vision related capabilities.
 
This codebase is designed to pair with the [DEEPi](https://web.uri.edu/oce/brennan-phillips/) hardware.
However, it may be useful in other context.
